  "description": "Gravelord Lych drains buffs from your Monkeys, healing itself in the process. When each skull on its health bar is reached, Lych goes ethereal, resurrecting the empty shells of recently popped MOAB class Bloons. When ethereal, Lych cannot be damaged until all resurrected Bloons have been popped, including the life-draining Lych-soul Bloon. Resurrected MOAB class Bloons do not spawn children, selling towers will heal Lych.",
